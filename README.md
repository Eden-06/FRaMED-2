# FRaMED SPL (2.0)


The *Full-fledged Role Modeling EDitor Software Product Line* (FRaMED SPL) (Version 2.0) is the reimplementation of FRaMED allowing the graphical specification of Role-based Software Systems by means of *compartments* (aka. *contexts*), *objects*, *roles*, and *relationships*. Moreover, it supports a varity of constraints upon roles and relationships.

While this was already possible in [FRaMED](https://github.com/leondart/FRaMED), this editor is a feature modular *graphical editor product line* (GEPL)¹ that permits users to dynamically reconfigure the available concepts, as well as constraints and developers to modularly extending the language family adding and removing concepts and constraints.
